# Tracker
This project consists of two Android applications.

The application Tracker tracks the user's location every 10 minutes and has a sensitivity of 60 meters. All collected coordinates are sent to a remote database.

The application Map retrieves the collected locations from the database and displays them on the map while connecting them with a line.

Both applications have login, registration and password recovery windows. To reset the password, the user receives an email with a new password.
